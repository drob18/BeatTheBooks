# BeatTheBooks

This is a repository made to try and beat the sports betting lines created by Vegas. Attempts to use predictive modeling to get outcomes of NBA games.

Takes input via an excel sheet created from www.basketballreference.com data. Uses offensive and defensive efficiency to predict a score for the games in Games.txt and outputs to STDout.
